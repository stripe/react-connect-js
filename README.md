> React components for Stripe.js and Stripe Elements

This project is a thin React wrapper around
[Connect embedded UIs](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-uis). It allows you to add embedded UIs to any React app, and manages the state and lifecycle of embedded UIs for
you.
